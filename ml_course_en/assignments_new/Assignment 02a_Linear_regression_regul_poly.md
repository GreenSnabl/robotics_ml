# Assignment for practical work 2a. Linear regression. Polynomial features. Regularization
## General Assignment

Before performing the practical work, you need download the dataset accordingly to the option on your machine (or cloud service)
1. Write a program that splits the original sample into a training set and a test set (training set, validation set, test set) with train_test_split method of Skikit Learn library
2. Using the scikit-learn library (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), train the linear regression model for the training sample (example: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_ols.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-linear-model-plot-ols-py)
3. Check the accuracy of the model from the test set
4. Build a model using a polynomial function (example: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_underfitting_overfitting.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-underfitting-overfitting-py). Build plots with the dependence of the error on the degree of the polynomial function.
5. Build a model using regularization (example: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html). On the basis of experiments, select parameters for regularization. Build plots with the dependence of the error on the regularization coefficient.
