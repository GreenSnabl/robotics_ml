Machine Learning only when programmable does not work.

First business understanding -> then second is data understanding -> data preparation -> then maybe model/experiments

training/test/validation or cross-val then metrics

select right cost/loss functions binary_crossentropy (sigmoid) / categorical_crossentropy

activation/loss/hyperparameters


neural networks

convolutional nns: go from low abstract features to high abstract feautres
image prediction, uncompressing
